#mapMovement extension
##Explanation
This extension takes care of the more resource friendly way for the player to move around the map.

This class hides all the subcontainers that are outside the current viewport / browser window. So we don't draw the objects outside our visible area.

##Possibilities in the future
- To play around with subContainer sizes and viewport sizes
